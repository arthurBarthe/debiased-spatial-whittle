    options:
      members: false
This package provides tools to define sampling grids. Currently, the code
is restricted to orthogonal grids. This is not a limitation inherent to the proposed
method, and it would not be very hard to generalize to non-orthogonal grids.

## ::: debiased_spatial_whittle.sampling
This package provides tools to efficiently sample from covariance models on
grids using circulant embeddings and the Fast Fourier Transform.
